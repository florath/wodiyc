### Common and Global Constants

Common:
  # The base thickness of the MDF plates used for (mostly) all
  # construction
  base_material_thickness: &thickness 19
  # In reality the base material is sometime thicker.
  # For my current material at some points thickness of
  # 19.3 - 19.5 mm was measured - for a 19mm sheet.
  # The problem is, that at least at some positions (e.g.
  # cutouts) it is important to be really the correct size
  # if not - the parts do not fit.
  base_material_real_thickness: 20
  # For coutouts in the base material

  screwhole_diameter: &screwhole_diameter 6
  # This is choosen in the way that a 6mm screw can be fixed
  # using this notch.
  screwhole_notch_diameter: &screwhole_notch_diameter  15
  # This can be used for standard washers
  screwhole_notch_diameter_washer: &screwhole_notch_diameter_big  18.5
  # This is used to 'hide' the screw heads.
  screwhole_notch_depth: &screwhole_notch_depth  4
  # When only a small depth should be done - mostly to fit the washer
  screwhole_notch_depth_washer: 1

  threaded_rod_x_diameter: 12

  threaded_rod_z_diameter: 12

  cross_nut_diameter: &cross_nut_diameter 10
  cross_nut_distance_from_edge: &distance_from_edge 25

  # This is a very central measurement:
  # it is the distance between the (central) pipe and the
  # elements around.
  # E.g. the adjustment blocks are sized in the way that
  # they use this measurement.
  pipe_distance: &pipe_distance 40

  # This is the security distance between moving parts.
