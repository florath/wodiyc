Introduction
============

During the years 2004 to 2006 some technical drawings of a wooden CNC
milling machine appeared in the Internet.  They were created by
someone called 'jgro'.  There were some versions of this machine and
it is still very popular - because it looks that nobody ever updated
the plans.

These plans had three major disadvantages:

#. All items and measures were given in inch.  Because I'm living in
   Europe, it is mostly impossible to get the items and tools to
   manufacture the original plans.

#. A lot of 'additional' items are not available as of today.

#. The plans were not intended to be used in a CNC router itself.

Therefore this project was started.


Requirements
============

A small list of requirements of this project:

#. Use metric measurements, items and tools

#. All items and tools should be available today and (somewhat) cheap.

#. The complete plans should be done in a way that they can be used
   in already build CNC milling machines to produce new ones.

#. The complete (software-) tool chain should be open source and
   available within the most common Linux distributions.

The initial toolchain is: python, blender and linuxcnc.


Notes
=====

Welcome to all who want to participate or improve.  Please just fork,
improve or change and send me a merge request.

Please note that I'm not a mechanics engineer.  All plans might
contain errors and bugs.  Use them with care.

The license is chosen in a way that commercial use of the plans and of
course of any CNC milling machine is allowed.  But if you change the
plans you have also to publish the changes.


Happy Milling.
