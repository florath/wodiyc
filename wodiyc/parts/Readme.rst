AntiBacklashNut
===============
The anti backlash nut is self-made as I did not found any
for M12.  It is created using two blocks from aluminuim.  The picture
shows a raw one - without the thread.

The complet setup uses two of the nuts. The following image shows a
test-setup. In the machine later on one of the nuts is mounted
to the axis.

Linear Bearing
==============
The linear bearings are the central concept of movement. They
are mounted on one side and role over the tubes on the other.

There are two sizes: the short for the Z axis and a longer one
for the X and Y axis.

Reference
=========
This part is used only as measurement reference. It should
be created on the host CNC machine and all the measurements
should be checked.

SupportBearing
==============
This part is used for manufacturing the linear bearing.

Support
=======
This is used for manufacuring other parts. It is fixed on the
CNC tables with M6 screws. Other parts can be fixed with clamps
to mill the edges.

ZAxisBearingSupport
===================
This part fixes the Z axis to the linear bearing.

ZAxisPlatform
=============
The tool is mounted here.

The original plan uses a 19mm MDF - which bends under a medium force.
Therefore the current approach uses two 16mm MDF plates glued together.
